I would like to thank Katrin Lohan for her support as both my accademic supervisor and friend. Thank you for keeping me on track and always being in my corner.

Much of the work I have carried out in this thesis could not have been done without the help of Ingo Keller. His guru-like knowledge of Python and infinite patience with teaching me to not only be a better scientist but also a better software developer has been invaluable.

I would like to thank my mother, Sue Phoenix for proof reading my thesis and correcting my English. I blame you for any typos that made it through. 

I would also like to thank Peter McKenna for reading my thesis and helping me to improve my communication of the ideas and science behind it.


Finally I would like to thank L\' ea Claude for her emotional support and encouragement throughout my PhD studies. I really could not have done this without you!

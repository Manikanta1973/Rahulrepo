\chapter{Introduction}
You need an introduction. This is the first chapter. Above we counted pages in small roman letters. Now we start counting anew using arabic numbers. This is as recommended in the guidelines.
\section{Example Section}
The chapters are split into sections (and subsections if you want). We can cite as normal \cite{Baez:9705009}.

Paragraphs are indented as usual. You can use preset Definition, Theorem and Corallary environments or define your preferred versions yourself.
\begin{mydef}[A Definition]
The current preset looks like this and is counted as $\langle{\rm Chapter Number}\rangle.x$.
\end{mydef}
\begin{mythm}[A Theorem]
Theorems work the same way and count together with definitions.
\end{mythm}
\begin{mycor}[A corollary]
And corollaries count dependent on the last theorem. You can of course change all this as usual --- currently you can find this in \texttt{macros.sty}.
\end{mycor}

\section{Introduction}\label{Lit:Intro}
In this section I will layout the key ideas and technologies which have inspired and enabled the research presented later in this thesis.

Due to the broad scope of the research carried out, the background section is losely presented so as to compare and contrast the state-of-the-art artificail neural network technologies with their biological analogues (where possible). As such, I survey a large body of machine learning, psychology and biology literature.

In doing this, I aim to demonstrate how ANNs have exceeded human performance in specific areas, whilst lagging far behind in many others. By bringing these divergent fields together, perhaps it is possible to find ways to improve ANNs whilst also further developing our understanding of what makes humans tick. 


\section{What are Artifical Neural Networks good at?}
Summary of sota literature demonstrating cool things ANNs can do.
\subsection{Classification}
\subsection{Generation}
\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}

\section{What are Artificial Neural Networks bad at?}
Explain how ANNs have specialised skill, not generalised skill - quote Rodney Brooks.
\subsection{data ineffciency}
look at oth ML methods which require less data but are generally less capable/require more engineering.

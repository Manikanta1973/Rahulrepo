\section{Why have one sensor when two are better?}
A key part of the human experience is that it is multisensory. In \cite{barsalou2008grounded}, Lawrence Barsalou speaks about how multisensory processing aids human cognition in a number of ways. Firstly, multisensory information aids in the classification of experiences by providing additional and complimentary information that is not accounted for in only a single modality. 

The Mcgurk effect \cite{mcgurk1976hearing} demonstrates how the visual stimuli of lip reading affects the classification of heard sounds. Whilst this effect can lead to incorrect classifications when misaligned data is provided e.g. utterances of the syllable [ba] dubbed on to lip movements for [ga], lead to normal adults hearing [da]; in normal circumstances, like when two people are speaking to one and other, lip reading aids in classifying heard sounds \cite{ma2009lip}. This is particularly important in noisy environments, which leads to another of Barsalou's ideas about multisensory processing: information redundancy.

The reason that lip reading can aid hearing in noisy evironments is that it provides an additional vector along which the human brain can reconstruct missing information. When something is mis-heard due to background noise, the visual information gained from looking at the face of the speaker can be used to reconstruct their utterance.

The ability to reconstruct missing data from a secondary modality has not only been seen in humans \cite{ma2009lip, samuel1997lexical} but has been demonstrated in computational modals for example, Ngiam et al.\cite{ngiam2011multimodal}.

In order to be able to reconstruct missing data from a secondary modality, symbol grounding needs to have occured, and the meaning of a percept in modality A must be known in modality B.
If both the forward and inverse relationship between modalities is known, then bidirectional symbol grounding has occured and we are able to reconstruct modality A from modality B and modality B from modality A.

In this chapter I will explore these two ideas, improved classification and reconstruction of missing information through  bidirectional symbol grounding using multimodal autoencoders (MAE).



\section{Generating images from natural language}
\subsection{Aims}
The experiment in this section demonstrates that having access to a second modality improves classification accuracy over the baseline accuracy of classification of either of the two individual modalities as well as how missing data can be reconstructed from a secondary modality.

\subsection{UCU Arabic Spoken Digits and MNIST} 
\label{sec:UCU}
This experiment utilises two datasets, UCU Arabic Spoken Digits (UCU) and MNIST Handwritten Digits (MNIST).

\subsubsection{UCU Arabic Spoken Digits}
UCU is a dataset containing the 13 Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients representing the audio of the digits 0 to 9 being said by 88 different speakers \cite{hammami2009tree,hammami2010improved}. It contains 8800 utterances (10 digits x 10 repetitions x 88 speakers). Audio was sampled at 11025Hz.

\paragraph{Padding of Utterances}
As utterances are not of a fixed length, it is necessary to pad the utterances to be equal length. The longest utterance in the dataset contains 93 samples. For ease of up and downsampling within the neural network, all uttereances are padded to be 100 samples long by appending zeros. Each sample is also padded to contain 16 features, the 13 MFCCs and 3 zeros to further facilitate up and down sampling\footnote{Up and down sampling is easier with even numbers of features and samples as we can half the size of the data using strided convolutions, s=(2,2), without worrying about integer division errors e.g. $5/2=2$ but $2\times2 \neq5$}.

As I will be classifying the digits, it is necessary to check that padding the digits does not provide a cheat for this. As such, I analise the mean number of samples for each digit and their standard deviations as depicted in \autoref{fig:ucu_dig_length}. I then perform a linear regression on the number of samples to demonstrate that it is not possible to accurately predict a digits class given only the length of the utterance.

\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:ucu_dig_length} shows the mean number of samples for each digit in the UCU dataset. Whilst there is a difference in the mean length of each digit, the standard deviation for each digit is relatively large as can be seen in \autoref{tab:UCU_sampLen}. Therefore, trying to classifiy the digits just by the number of samples in an example, is ineffective.

		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			Digit & Mean Length (samples) & Standard Deviation \\ \hline
			0 & 39.66 & $\mypm 29.25$ \\ \hline
			1 & 37.27 & $\mypm 25.58$ \\ \hline

		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Mean length and standard deviation of digits in the UCU dataset.}
		\label{tab:UCU_sampLen}
	\end{table}


Performing a linear regression on the number of samples for each digit versus its class, we get an accuracy of 6.18\% when classifying the test set.

\subsubsection{MNIST Handwritten Digits}
MNIST is a well known and ofte used dataset in the machine learning community. It contains 60000 training samples and 10000 test samples, evenly split between the digits 0 to 9. 
Each digit is presented as a grey-scale, 28x28 pixel image \cite{lecun1998mnist}. 

\subsection{Problem Description}
The experiments with these datasets will explore two problems, classification and bidirectional symbol grounding. 

\subsubsection{Classification}
Each of the utterances and images from the UCU and MNIST datasets are classified as being a numeric digit, 0 to 9. By combining both datasets, we can explore whether the addition of a second modality enhances overall classification accuracy.

I start off exploring the classification abilities of neural networks by performing a linear regression with a single, dense neural network layer with a softmax activation on the activation of the embedding layer of an autoencoder. To generate baseline classifications accuracies for each dataset, I use autoencoders for each modality separately.

Once a classification baseline has been established for each dataset, I make use of a MAE, using paired examples from each dataset to train it.

\subsubsection{Bidirectional Symbol Grounding}

I demonstrate that a neural network can perform bidirectional symbol grounding \cite{barsalou2008grounded} when presented with aligned images and utterances. To explore this, I show how a MAE can learn to reconstruct the correct image of a digit given the MFCCs of an utterance as well as MFCCs which have a small mean squared error from the correct utterance given an image of a digit. This shows that an internal symbolic language has been learnt in the form of the latent embedding created by the encoders of the MAE.


\subsection{Experiment Details}
Images from the MNIST dataset are kept at their original scale of 28x28 pixels and are normalised such that each pixel has a value from 0 to 1 based on it's intensity, with zero equating to black and 1 being white.

The UCU dataset is normalised so that all MFCCs take a value from 0 to 1 based on the value of the MFCC such that the highest value is 1 and the lowest 0. Utterances are padded to be 100x16 as previously described.

\paragraph{Combining Datasets}
\label{sec:UCU_mnist_comb}
Due to the difference in size between the datasets, 8,800 samples for UCU and 80,000 samples for MNIST, I randomly sample from the UCU dataset and pair this with a sample from MNIST. This means that each sample from UCU is used approxiamtely 9.1 times ($80000/8800=9.0909$) in the training data.

\paragraph{Merging Modalities}
In order to combine the two different modalities, I explore different merging techniques: concatenation (\textit{Concat}) and addition (\textit{Add}). To do this, the embeddings of both modalities are ensured to have the same shape and then are merged using the methods described in \autoref{eqn:concat} and \autoref{eqn:add} for concatenation and addition, respectively. %and \ref{eqn:xply}.

 \begin{equation}\label{eqn:concat}
 	merged = Im_i^{emb} || MFCC_i^{emb} 	
 \end{equation}

 \begin{equation}\label{eqn:add}  
 	merged = Im_i^{emb} + MFCC_i^{emb} 	
 \end{equation}
 
  %\begin{equation}
 	%merged = x1^*_i * x2^*_i
 	%\label{eqn:xply}  
 %\end{equation}

Where $Im_i^{emb}$ and $MFCC_i^{emb}$ represent the embeddings, output by the image and MFCC encoders respectively for image and MFCC inputs $Im_i$ and $MFCC_i$.

\subsubsection{Training Procedures}

The MAEs are trained in two different ways for both types of merging, these are referred to as bimodal (Bi) and randomly degraded (RD).

\paragraph{Bimodal}
Under the Bi training procedure, the MAE is presented with bimodal input for all training instances. Both image and MFCC inputs are present for all training steps and the MAE is trained to reproduce this input as its output.

\paragraph{Randomly Degraded}
Under the RD training procedure, one third of image inputs are removed at random and a third of MFCC inputs are removed at random. It is ensured that each training instance always has at least one input modality present. That is, a training instance never has both its image and MFCC input removed. 

The removed modality is replaced with an array of zeros of the same shape as the original input (28x28 for the image and 100x16 for MFCCs).

The MAE is then trained to reproduce both the image and MFCCs regardless of whether one of these has been ommited from the input.

\subsubsection{Testing Conditions}
Each MAE (\textit{Concat} and \textit{Add}) was tested in three different ways, Bimodal, Image Only and MFCC Only.

\paragraph{Bimodal}
In the Bimodal testing condition both image and MFCC data are used as input for each testing instance and I am interested in observing the classification accuracy as well as the total regeneration error.

\paragraph{Image Only}
In the Image Only testing condition, only images are provided as input data. I am interested in the classification accuracy as well as the MFCC reconstruction error. I am not interested in the image reconstruction error, as it is expected that, as the image is provided as input this will be low (which it is for all models and training procedures as seen in \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_master_res}).  

\paragraph{MFCC Only}
Similarly to the Image Only condition, the MFCC Only (MFCC) condition provides only MFCCs as input and I am interested in the classification accuracy as well as the image reconstruction error. I am not interested in the MFCC regeneration loss as MFCCs are given as input it will be low (which it is for all models and training procedures as seen in \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_master_res}).  

\subsubsection{Network Description}
\paragraph{Baseline Models}
To generate the baseline classification accuracies for both the UCU and MNIST data, I make use of (unimodal) autoencoders. The descrition of the autoencoder for the MNIST dataset can be found in \autoref{tab:MNIST_AE_description} and the autoencoder for the UCU dataset in \autoref{tab:UCU_AE_description}.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Classification Results}
The complete set of results for this experiment are available in \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_master_res} in \autoref{appendix:A}. The most important results are shown in the following three tables: \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_bi_res} for the Bimodal testing condition, \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_im_res} for the Image Only condition and \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_mfcc_res} for the MFCC Only testing condition. 

All results reported here are the mean of a four-fold cross validation. Each training and testing condition was run four times and the average results are shown.


\begin{table}[h]

		\caption{Mean Squared Errors for the Bimodal testing condition.}
		\label{tab:mnist_ucu_bi_res}

\end{table}

In \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_bi_res} it can be seen that both concatenate and addition merging produce models with better prediction accuracy than the baseline models, regardless of training procedure.

\begin{table}
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Model & Training &  MFCC MSE &  Acc \\ \hline
		Image AE & Im 		&  		    			& \textbf{0.9883}	\\ \hline		
\multirow{2}{*}{Add MAE} & Bi & 	0.1641			& 0.4501 			\\ \cline{2-4}
						  & RD & \textbf{0.0455}	& 0.9834 			\\ \hline	
		
\multirow{2}{*}{Concat MAE} & Bi & 	0.2029		&	0.3496 			\\ \cline{2-4}

		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Mean Squared Errors for the Image Only testing condition.}
		\label{tab:mnist_ucu_im_res}

\end{table}

In comparison to the results shown in \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_bi_res}, the results in \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_im_res} show that the MAEs trained using the Bi training procedure do not generalise well when only a single input modality is available. Where as the MAEs trained using the RD training procedure perform almost as well as the baseline model. 
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Model & Training & Im MSE &  Acc \\ \hline
				
				MFCC AE & MFCC & 					& 	\textbf{0.9832}	\\ \hline		
\multirow{2}{*}{Add MAE} & Bi & 	0.1138			& 	0.9624 			\\ \cline{2-4}
						  & RD &	0.0556			&	0.9789			\\ \hline	
		
\multirow{2}{*}{Concat MAE} & Bi &	0.1138			&	0.9455			\\ \cline{2-4}		
							 & RD & \textbf{0.0554}	& 	0.9827 			\\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Mean Squared Errors for the MFCC Only testing condition.}
		\label{tab:mnist_ucu_mfcc_res}

\end{table}

Similarly, the reuslts in \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_mfcc_res} show that the behaviour of the MAEs is very similar under the RD training procedure regardless of whether it is MFCCs or images provided as input. However, the classification accuracy remains reasonably good under the Bi training procedure when only MFCCs are present. 

\subsubsection{Reconstruction Results}

In \autoref{fig:mnistDigits} examples of reconstructed digits generated by both the \textit{Add} and \textit{Concat} MAEs are shown.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:5s} shows a comparison of two different examples of the digit ``5''. One is (subjectively) poorly written and the other is more prototypical and well formed. Under different testing conditions, the MAEs regenerate different ``fives''.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Discussion}

\subsubsection{Discussion of Classification Results}
\autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_bi_res} shows that both the \textit{Add} and \textit{Concat} MAEs have better classification accuracy than the baseline, unimodal models. However, it is not clear that there is a difference in between the two training procedures, Bi and RD.

The difference between the two training procedures becomes clear in \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_im_res} where it can be seen that the MAEs trained using the Bi training procedure have much worse classification rates when presented with only images as input. Models perform less than half as well as the baseline model, 0.4501 (\textit{Add}) and 0.3496(\textbf{Concat}) versus 0.9832 for the baseline image autoencoder.

There is a trade off between unimodal accuracy and mulitmodal accuracy in the RD training procedure MAEs. Whilst both the \textit{Add} and \textit{Concat} MAEs outperform the baseline models in the Bimodal test condition, they have slightly worse performance when tested with either images or MFCCs only. For example, the best performance is given by the \textit{Add} MAE under the RD training procedure when both images and MFCCs are present as inputs, with an accuracy of 0.9993. However, if one of the modalities is removed, the accuracy drops to 0.9834 and 0.9789 for Image Only and MFCC Only testing respectively. Comparing this to the baseline unimodal models, we see classification accuracies of 0.9883 and 0.9832 for image and MFCC autoencoders respectively. 

There is a drop of 0.0049 and 0.0043 for Image Only and MFCC Only testing using the \textit{Add} MAE. However, this reduction in performance is conterbalanced by the improvement in performnace when both modalities are present, 0.9993 versus the 0.9883 and 0.9832 of the baseline models. This improvement of 0.0110 to 0.0161 over the baseline image and MFCC autoencoders is more than twice the decrease in performance when only one modality is available. 

Specifically, the improvement of Bimodal classification is 2.24 times larger than the decrease in performance when only images are available ($0.011 / 0.0049 = 2.24$). Comparing to the MFCC baseline, the Bimodal performance improvement is 3.74 times larger than the decrease in performance when only MFCCs are available.

\subsubsection{Discussion of Reconstruction Results}
Observing \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_bi_res}, \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_im_res} and \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_mfcc_res} it can be seen that different models have different reconstruction errors (Mean Squared Error). Whilst all MAE models had higher reconstruction errors than the baseline models, this is to be expected. The MAE models are trading off between representing each modality well, whilst the unimodal autoencoders that give the baseline numbers can use their full capacity to minimise the reconstruction error of their modaility as they do not have to reconstruct the second modality. 

That being said, the image reconstruction error, is comparable across all MAE models, approximately 0.0031, (see table \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_bi_res} and is very close to the baseline of 0.0027 under the Bimodal testing condition (i.e. when the images to be reconstructed are available as input). Further to this, the image reconstruction error for the MFCC Only testing condition is still small, though an order of magnitude worse, for the MAEs trained using the RD procedure.

\paragraph{Image reconstruction from MFCCs}
The increase in image reconstruction error when only MFCCs are provided as input is due to the construction of an internal symbolic language which represents the meaning of both the utterances but not necessarily their fine details. For example, looking at \autoref{fig:5s} we see that there are different ways to write the number 5, however both of these images have the same meaning, ``five''. It is more important to preserve this meaning than the minutia of the original images. The same can be said for reconstructing MFCCs, their meaning is more important than their exact enunciation.  

The MFCC reconstruction error is best for the baseline model but is only 4.0265 times worse for the best performing model on this task. Considering how small the baseline error is, being four times worse, is still good performance, especially considering the difficulty of the task.

\paragraph{MFCC reconstruction from Images}
The MFCC reconstruction error is an order of magnitude worse than the image reconstruction error. In part this is due to the nature of the data, as seen by the difference in baseline reconstruction errors. It appears to be more difficult to reconstruct MFCCs than images, even when MFCCs are given as input.
Another contributing factor to the worse MFCC reconstruction error for the MAEs, is the inbalance between sample numbers for MNIST and UCU. Whilst both datasets are balanced within themselves (there are an equal number of training samples for each class) there is a big difference between the sizes of MNIST and UCU. 

The difference in sizes between the datasets means that reconstructing MFCCs from image inputs will map a large number of inputs to a smaller number of outputs and vice-versa for generating images from MFCC inputs. Therefore images in the test set which look similar to images in the training set, will be mapped to MFCCs similar to those which the training images map too. As there are a smaller number of MFCC examples to map to, our output is less likely to be normally distributed. Whilst idealy we would like to map similar looking digits to similar sounding utterances, there is no gaurantee that this is true, either in our dataset or in general. People with similar handwritting don't necessarily have similar voices. This is simulated by the random assignment of images to MFCCs but this results in discontinuities in the latent space of the network, particularly with respect to generating MFCCs, of which we have fewer examples to capture the true distribution of the data.

Conversely, as there are more examples of images of digits, the distribution of the latent space with respect to the images can get closer to modelling the real distribution of the images. Therefore, given a test MFCC, regardless of whether it is similar to a training MFCC example, its target image, is more likely to be similar to images in the training data.

\paragraph{Effects of randomly degrading inputs}
\autoref{fig:mnistDigits} shows that randomly degrading the training data has a significant effect, beyond just the improvements to classification accuracy seen in \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_bi_res}, \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_im_res} and \autoref{tab:mnist_ucu_mfcc_res}. Both the \textit{Add} and \textit{Concat} MAEs fail to learn to generate images from MFCC data using the Bi training procedure.

Comparing the images generated by the \textit{Add} and \textit{Concat} MAEs (\autoref{fig:mnistDigits}) for the MFCC test condition when the training data has been randomly degraded, it can be seen that the \textit{Concat} MAE outperforms the \textit{Add} MAE. This is particularly clear when you look at the ``five'' and ``six'' generated by the \textit{Add} MAE for RD X MFCC, where the MAE has failed to correctly generate a ``six'' and has instead generated a ``five'', which is similar to the prototypical five generated when MFCCs for a five are presented.
Unlike the \textit{Add} MAE, the \textit{Concat} MAE, correctly generates all digits, including ``six''.

\paragraph{Multiple generations of the same digit}
In \autoref{fig:5s} we see that different examples of the same digit produce different generation results. Most interestingly however, are the generated ``fives'' shown in the RD X MFCC row. A more prototypical ``five'' is generated from MFCCs than if an image of a non-prototypical five is given. This shows that the meaning of the MFCCs have been grounded in the image modality and that an internal symbolic language has been learnt, i.e. the latent embedding of MFCCs are a symbolic representation which has meaning in both MFCC and image space, hence the ability to generate meaningful images and MFCCs from these embeddings.

\section{Conclusion}
Whilst multimodal systems can provide better classification accuracy, this comes at the cost of higher computational costs and lower classification accuracy when only one modality is available as demonstrated by the results presented in this chapter.

The ability to reconstruct missing data from a secondary modality demonstrates how an internal symbolic language can be learnt in an unsupervised fashion by processing aligned percepts in multiple modalities.

In future it would be worth while to observe how the reconstructed data can be exploited to improve classification accuracy, for example by first generating a missing data point from modality A and then performing a classification on the embedding of data from modality B and the generated modality A.

This experiment lays the ground work for the next chapter where I will look at how a more complex internal symbolic language can be developed and exploited. 
%I will also discuss how this can be applied to creating robots capable of life long learning.

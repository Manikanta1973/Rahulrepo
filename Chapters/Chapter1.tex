\section{How do Artifical Neural Networks compare to the human brain?}
In this thesis I will exam how Artificial Neural Networks compare to the human brain and how we can take inspiration from human intelligence to improve the capabilities of ANNs. 

\section{Motivation}
%Recent developments in image classification, captioning and question answering have shown neural networks are capable of performing complex, high level tasks which incorporate a multitude of human like skills \cite{jia2015guiding}. Image captioning combines knowledge of object appearance, location, use and natural language generation to produce human like sentences describing the contents of an image \cite{vinyals2015show} \cite{ren2015exploring}.

%The reverse of this process, image generation from a textual description, is a new area of research which is begining to gain much interest \cite{reed2016generative}. Along these lines, my research focuses on combining these tasks into a single neural network, framing the problem within a multimodal autoencoder, where recovery of both an image and its description from a joint embedding space is the goal.

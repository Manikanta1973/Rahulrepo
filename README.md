# PhD_Thesis_Multimodal_Representation_Learning
This is the tex files and images etc, used to generate my PhD Thesis for which I was jointly awarded a Doctorate by the University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University following my work as part of the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics.

The thesis focuses on developing unsupervised methods for symbol grouding for both visual and linguistic symbols, using deep learning.
